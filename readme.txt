### How Does Bertha AI Work?
This is pretty interesting.

Over the past few decades, we‚Äôve gotten used to a certain way of interacting with technology. The ‚ÄúIf>>Then‚Äù method that traditional code is based on.
This doesn‚Äôt apply to AI.

Bertha doesn‚Äôt take blocks of content and call them ‚Äúideas‚Äù.

**AI works more like the human mind:** 

When we speak or write, we string ideas, concepts and previous knowledge to single words, or fractions of words that compile sentences, paragraphs and finally a story.

Often we don‚Äôt know what we will say when we start to speak, just like I didn‚Äôt know that I will be writing this exact sentence when I started writing this article. Which now makes it a completely original piece of content.

Some of us do it better than others but we can all be trained to do it. In the same way that we trained Bertha from our own experience.

She already knows more than you and I will ever know, in terms of raw data, and with the proper training, we were able to get her to generate content that is often better than what I would have written myself.

Now, based on her previous knowledge and training, she‚Äôs able to write about things she doesn‚Äôt know anything about ‚Äì Like a new business you created, or a brand new product or course you‚Äôre about to launch.

**In fact, while I was the editor of this page and I had to connect some of the pieces, Bertha helped me create most of it. **

Pretty cool right?
